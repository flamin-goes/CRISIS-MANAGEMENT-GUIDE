TYPES OF BACKUPS

Understanding the various types of data backup solutions enables organizations to tailor their backup strategies to meet specific requirements, such as data recovery objectives, storage constraints, and operational considerations. By selecting the appropriate backup approach or combination of approaches, businesses can effectively protect their data assets and mitigate the impact of potential crises. Following are some popular types of backups:

1. Full Backups:

A full backup involves copying all data from a source to a backup storage medium. It provides a complete snapshot of the data at a specific point in time.
- Advantages: 
  Full backups offer comprehensive data protection and simplify the restoration process since all data is
  stored in one backup set.
- Disadvantages: 
  They consume more storage space and require longer backup windows, especially for large datasets.

2. Incremental Backups:

Incremental backups only copy data that has changed since the last backup, significantly reducing backup time and storage space requirements.
- Advantages: They are efficient in terms of storage and bandwidth utilization, making them ideal for
  frequent backups.
- Disadvantages: Restoration may require multiple incremental backups along with the initial full backup,
  which can increase recovery time.

3. Differential Backups:

Differential backups copy all data that has changed since the last full backup. Unlike incremental backups, they don't rely on the previous backup iteration.
- Advantages: Differential backups simplify the restoration process by requiring only the last full backup
  and the most recent differential backup.
- Disadvantages: They consume more storage space compared to incremental backups, especially over time as
  the size of differentials grows.

4. Mirror Backups:

Mirror backups create an exact replica of the source data, maintaining file structure and attributes. Any changes made to the source are reflected in the mirror backup.
- Advantages: Mirror backups provide real-time synchronization between source and backup, ensuring
  immediate access to the latest data.
- Disadvantages: They require ample storage space and continuous synchronization processes, which may
  impact performance.

5. Snapshot Backups:

Snapshot backups capture the state of a system or dataset at a specific moment in time, allowing for quick and efficient backups without interrupting ongoing operations.
= Advantages: Snapshots are fast and minimally disruptive, making them suitable for virtualized
  environments and critical systems.
- Disadvantages: Snapshots typically rely on underlying storage technologies, such as RAID or SAN, and may not be suitable for all data types or scenarios.
